    Description: Takes Calgary's Open Data API (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.calgary.ca/crbp-innf) and sorts
    the data into alphabetical order. This program will ask some specific questions in order to narrow down the data
    needed to display the total energy consumed each month for that year.
